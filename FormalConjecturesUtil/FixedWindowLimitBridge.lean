# Fixed-window limit and cofinal-window bridge

Abstract order-theoretic pieces used by the AEGIS fixed-window Weil lane.

The first theorem packages the finite-to-limit step: if a sequence of
quadratic values converges to the target value and is bounded below by a
second sequence converging to zero, then the target value is nonnegative.

The second package records that, for any monotone window predicate, the
windows `R = n * π` are cofinal among all positive real windows.

No matrix positivity premise is manufactured here.
