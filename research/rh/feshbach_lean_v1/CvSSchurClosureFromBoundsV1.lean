AEGIS Ω — Schur low-block closure from coercivity and a Brow budget.
READ-ONLY source candidate. Exact source anchor cf9372f13370596d51eb36134f141f199ba60b5c.
Lean kernel compilation has NOT been performed in this environment.

Names: A_CvS is the raw CvS matrix; T_trace is a scalar trace-integral upper
bound. Neither is the invertible basis map R_basis from the projected-certificate
experiment. The bounds below apply to the *actual* lowCoeff map.
