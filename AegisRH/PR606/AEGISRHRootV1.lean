AEGIS Ω — location-independent RH proof entrypoint.

This module uses Lean module names, never filesystem-relative imports.
Its source file can be located anywhere; the build must provide the module
search path (LEAN_PATH) containing the compiled dependency closure.

This intentionally exposes the exact remaining premise instead of claiming
that the Riemann Hypothesis follows without it.
